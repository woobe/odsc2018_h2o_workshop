## Prerequisites

### R

Currently, the only version of R that is known to be **incompatible with H2O is R version 3.1.0** (codename “Spring Dance”). If you are using that version, we recommend upgrading the R version before using H2O.

### IDE

Studio (my own preference)

### R Packages

Please install the following R packages from CRAN:

- `install.packages("h2o")`
- `install.packages("lime")`
- `install.packages("mlbench")`


That's all :)
